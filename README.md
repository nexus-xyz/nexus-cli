## Nexus Network

[Nexus](https://nexus.xyz/) is a global distributed prover network that unites the world's computers to power a new and
better Internet: the Verifiable Internet.

## Network Status

**Current Version**: v0.10.17

There have been several testnets so far:

- Testnet 0: [October 8 â€“ 28, 2024](https://blog.nexus.xyz/nexus-launches-worlds-first-open-prover-network/)
- Testnet I: [December 9 â€“ 13, 2024](https://blog.nexus.xyz/the-new-nexus-testnet-is-live/)
- Testnet II: [February 18 â€“ 22, 2025](https://blog.nexus.xyz/testnet-ii-is-open/)
- Devnet: [February 22 - June 20, 2025](https://docs.nexus.xyz/layer-1/testnet/devnet)
- Testnet III: [March 2025 - Ongoing](https://blog.nexus.xyz/live-everywhere/)

### Recent Improvements (v0.10.17)

- **Enhanced Thread Management**: Automatic optimization based on CPU cores and available memory
- **Improved Memory Checking**: Real-time monitoring with detailed warnings
- **Better Error Handling**: Timeout protection and progressive error categorization
- **Performance Optimization**: More efficient parallel processing with `join_all`
- **Stability Improvements**: Enhanced error recovery and resource management

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Precompiled Binary (Recommended)

For the simplest and most reliable installation:

```bash
curl https://cli.nexus.xyz/ | sh
```

This downloads the latest binary, prompts for Terms of Use acceptance, and starts interactive mode.

#### Non-Interactive Installation

For automated installations (e.g., in CI):

```bash
curl -sSf https://cli.nexus.xyz/ -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
NONINTERACTIVE=1 ./install.sh
```

### Proving

Proving with the CLI is documented [here](https://docs.nexus.xyz/layer-1/testnet/cli-node).

To start with an existing node ID, run:

```bash
nexus-cli start --node-id <your-node-id>
```

Alternatively, you can register your wallet address and create a node ID with the CLI, or at [app.nexus.xyz](https://app.nexus.xyz).

```bash
nexus-cli register-user --wallet-address <your-wallet-address>
nexus-cli register-node --node-id <your-cli-node-id>
nexus-cli start
```

To run the CLI non-interactively, you can also opt to start it in headless mode.

```bash
nexus-cli start --headless
```

#### Quick Reference

The `register-user` and `register-node` commands will save your credentials to `~/.nexus/config.json`. To clear credentials, run:

```bash
nexus-cli logout
```

For troubleshooting or to see available command-line options, run:

```bash
nexus-cli --help
```

### Thread Management and Performance

The Nexus CLI automatically optimizes thread usage based on your system's capabilities:

- **Default threads**: Half of your CPU cores for optimal performance
- **Maximum threads**: Capped at 75% of total cores to maintain system stability
- **Memory checking**: Each thread requires ~4GB RAM, automatically adjusted based on available memory

#### Thread Configuration

```bash
# Let CLI auto-detect optimal thread count (recommended)
nexus-cli start

# Manually specify thread count
nexus-cli start --max-threads 4

# Enable detailed memory checking
nexus-cli start --check-memory
```

### Adaptive Task Difficulty

The Nexus CLI features an **adaptive difficulty system** that automatically adjusts task difficulty based on your node's performance. This ensures optimal resource utilization while preventing system overload.

#### How It Works

- **Starts at**: `small` difficulty
- **Auto-promotes**: If tasks complete in < 7 minutes

#### When to Override Difficulty

**Lower Difficulty** (e.g. `small` or `small_medium`):
- Resource-constrained systems
- Background processing alongside other apps
- Testing/development environments
- Battery-powered devices

**Higher Difficulty** (e.g. `large`, `extra_large`, or `extra_large_2`):
- High-performance hardware (8+ cores, 16+ GB RAM)
- Dedicated proving machines
- Maximum reward optimization

#### Using Difficulty Override

```bash
# Lower difficulty for resource-constrained systems
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty small
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty small_medium

# Higher difficulty for powerful hardware
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty medium
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty large
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large_2
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large_3
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large_4

# Equivalent to extra_large_4 if no extra_large_5 tasks available
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large_5

# Case-insensitive (all equivalent)
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty MEDIUM
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty medium
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty Medium
```

#### Difficulty Guidelines

| Difficulty | RAM Required | CPU Cores | Use Case |
|------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| `small` | 4-8GB | 1-2 cores | Default, starting task |
| `small_medium` | 8-12GB | 2-4 cores | Building reputation |
| `medium` | 12-16GB | 4-6 cores | Standard desktop/laptop |
| `large` | 16-24GB | 6-8 cores | High-performance desktop |
| `extra_large` and above | 24GB+ | 8+ cores | Dedicated proving machines, maximum points |

> **Tip**: Use `nexus-cli start --help` to see the full auto-promotion details in the CLI help text.

#### Troubleshooting Difficulty Issues

**Tasks taking too long:**

Try a lower difficulty:

```bash
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty small_medium
```

**Want more challenging tasks:**

Request a harder difficulty. Note: It will still take time to build up reputation to get the requested difficulty:

```bash
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large_2
```

**Unsure about system capabilities:**
- Use the default adaptive system (no `--max-difficulty` flag needed)
- The system will automatically find the optimal difficulty for your hardware
- CLI now defaults to optimal thread count based on your CPU cores
- Memory checking ensures stable operation without system overload
- Only override if you're fine-tuning performance for specific use cases

### Docker Installation

For containerized deployments:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Update the node ID in `docker-compose.yaml`
3. Build and run:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs  # Check logs
docker compose down  # Shutdown
```

For direct Docker usage:

```bash
docker run -d --name nexus-node --restart unless-stopped --init \
  nexusxyz/nexus-cli:latest start --headless --node-id <your-node-id>
```

## Terms of Use

Use of the CLI is subject to the [Terms of Use](https://nexus.xyz/terms-of-use).
First-time users running interactively will be prompted to accept these terms.

---

## Node ID

During the CLI's startup, you'll be asked for your node ID. To skip prompts in a
non-interactive environment, manually create a `~/.nexus/config.json` in the
following format:

```json
{
   "node_id": "<YOUR NODE ID>"
}
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### System Requirements

**Minimum Requirements:**
- 4GB RAM (for 1 thread)
- 2 CPU cores
- Stable internet connection

**Recommended for Optimal Performance:**
- 16GB+ RAM (for 4+ threads)
- 8+ CPU cores
- SSD storage
- Dedicated proving machine

### Memory Management

The CLI includes intelligent memory management:
- Automatic thread count optimization based on available memory
- Real-time memory monitoring and warnings
- Graceful degradation on memory-constrained systems
- Each proving thread requires approximately 4GB RAM
